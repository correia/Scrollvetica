Scrollvetica 1.0 (v11)
----------------------

- Scrollvetica only inverts scroll events for the active user session. This
  makes it possible to use Scrollvetica and Fast User Switching without
  having one login session affect another.
  
Scrollvetica 1.0 (v10)
----------------------

- Enabled 32-bit Intel builds.

Scrollvetica 1.0 (v9)
---------------------

- Added an option, based in spirit on the patches from Chris Farber, which
  make the status item optional.
  
  If you turn off "Show in Menu Bar", Scrollvetica will suppress the status
  item when it is launched as a login item. (This should cover nearly all of
  the cases where people want to hide the status item, while still making it
  behave reasonably for quick interactive use and trying out.)

  If the status item is hidden, double-clicking the Scrollvetica icon in the
  finder will make it visible again.

Scrollvetica 1.0 (v8)
---------------------

- New icons based on contributions from anonymous.


Scrollvetica 1.0 (v7)
---------------------

- Initial release.
